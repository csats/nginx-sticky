nginx-sticky
============

Yet Another nginx container with [nginx-sticky-module-ng](https://bitbucket.org/nginx-goodies/nginx-sticky-module-ng)
installed. Based on `debian:jessie`.

It's the base for [csats-balancer](https://github.com/csats/csats-balancer).

If you want to do something with it, you should probably put something at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. It does nothing by
default.
